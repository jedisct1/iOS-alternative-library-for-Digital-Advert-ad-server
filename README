An independant, opensource client library for displaying ads served by
Digital Advert on iOS devices.

Features:

- asynchronous: it never blocks even if the remote server is
unreachable.

- the library sends as many calls to the server as the number of pages
that were supposedly loaded. Thus, counters are consistent with other
counters acting in a similar way. Every call to [SimpleAdView load:]
will trigger an asynchronous HTTP request.

- but in order to avoid flickering and degrading the user experience, ads
are only refreshed when they actually change.

- requests are queued and processed in batch after a configurable
delay, so that loading an ad doesn't have much impact on a
network-enabled application.
